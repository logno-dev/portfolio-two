# portfolio-two

This repo hosts my most recent attempt at creating a portfolio website.

This is hosted a published entirely on Github with Github pages and the live site can be viewed at [logno.dev](https://logno.dev/)

My goal with this project was to write the entire project from scratch without using a framework. I wanted the portfolio to be simple, yet interactive.

There does seem to be a bit of an issue with the intersection observer when viewed on mobile, but it works flawlessly on the desktop.

### TODO

I should update the projects listed. Namely, I should add my blog and my grandmothers autobiograghy that I transcribed to website format.
